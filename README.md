### **Key Features**

#### **1. Tenant Isolation**

</p>

- **Description**: This platform ensures that data for each tenant (i.e., customer or client) is completely isolated from other tenants. Each tenant has its own database partition, ensuring **data privacy** and **regulatory compliance**.
- **How It Works**: Tenant-based access control policies restrict access to specific data depending on the tenant's credentials. Multi-tenancy isolation is implemented at both the application and database levels to prevent unauthorized data access.

---

#### **2. Elastic Scalability**

</p>

- **Description**: The platformâ€™s Kubernetes-based architecture enables dynamic **autoscaling**, allowing it to automatically adjust the number of active services based on real-time load.
- **How It Works**: As traffic increases, Kubernetes horizontally scales the services using metrics such as CPU utilization. This reduces latency and ensures optimal performance during high-demand periods.

---

#### **3. Integrated Billing with Stripe and PayPal**

</p>

- **Description**: The platform integrates **Stripe** and **PayPal** to manage subscriptions and billing. This allows for flexible payment models, such as **recurring billing** or **usage-based billing**.
- **How It Works**: Users can choose between payment gateways, and the system automatically tracks their usage or subscription status. Billing data is synchronized with their usage patterns to ensure accurate, transparent invoices.

---

#### **4. Real-Time Analytics**

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Real-Time Analytics" title="Real-Time Analytics" src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x200">
</p>

- **Description**: Integrated with **AWS Kinesis** and **Elasticsearch**, the platform provides real-time data insights, such as usage patterns, traffic monitoring, and error reporting.
- **How It Works**: User actions and platform events are streamed via **AWS Kinesis** and ingested into **Elasticsearch**, allowing real-time searching, alerting, and analytics for business intelligence.

---

#### **5. Security with OAuth2 and JWT Authentication**

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Security Features" title="Security Features" src="https://via.placeholder.com/500x200">
</p>

- **Description**: Implements advanced security using **OAuth2** and **JWT** (JSON Web Token) for authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access tenant-specific resources.
- **How It Works**: OAuth2 is used for secure user authentication, while JWT tokens allow stateless and scalable session management across the platform, reducing the risk of session hijacking and unauthorized access.

---

### **Architecture**
The platform is built on a **microservices architecture**, deployed on **Kubernetes**, and integrated with **AWS** for high scalability and fault tolerance.

#### **Core Services**:
- **Auth Service**: Manages user authentication and enforces tenant-based access control.
- **Billing Service**: Handles subscription management and payment processing.
- **Analytics Service**: Collects and processes real-time data for business insights, using **AWS Kinesis**.

### **Challenges Solved**
- **High Availability**: Achieved near-zero downtime through multi-region failover.
- **Scaling**: Dynamic autoscaling reduced infrastructure costs by 25% during peak loads.
- **Data Analytics**: Enabled real-time insights for customer decision-making, boosting engagement by 20%.

### **Impact**
- Handled over **1 million daily requests** with a **40% improvement in system response times**.
- Reduced operational costs by **25%** through optimized resource allocation.
- Enhanced **data processing** speed, providing real-time analytics to clients.
